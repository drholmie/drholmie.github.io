I am currently an undergraduate at PES university, pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. I have recently been focussed on Android development, security, distributed computing and their architecture.

I also volunteer and am an active member at Microsoft Innovation Labs, PES. I have also worked on and mentored project [Forget-me-Not](https://github.com/Dcoder99/Forget-me-not). I have also previously worked on a traffic redirection app during road flooding. 

Most recent projects include a distributed Machine Learning API(coming soon), an app that alerts workers if they are going to fall asleep [Headsup](https://github.com/drholmie/headsup), a [distributed key-value store](https://github.com/drholmie/PseudoDist) from scratch using python and zookeeper, while dabbling in my hobbies as well. 
Thanks for visiting.
